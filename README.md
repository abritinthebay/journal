# Journal: A Personal Publishing Platform

> **Journal**. \ˈjər-nəl\ _Noun_. Definition: chronicle, account, narrative, _life_.

Journal is a markdown-focused blogging platform. It keeps all the markdown for all you posts and generates static files to serve them as html.

It's small, simple, and fast!

> Isn't it mysterious to begin a new journal like this? I can run my fingers through the fresh clean pages but I cannot guess what the writing on them will be.
> ― Maud Hart Lovelace

## Getting Started

Assuming you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) installed already then you can just run journal directly through `npx`.

```Shell
	npx journal
```

You can also install the binary globally like so:

```Shell
	npm i -g journal
```
